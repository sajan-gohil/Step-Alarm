# Step-Alarm
An alarm that requires you to take 10 steps for it to stop ringing.

Set 1 alarm. Move your phone when it rings. Wake up on time (hopefully).

Currently uses the gyroscope in your phone to track motion and count steps. This is not a very accurate method but all phones don't have step counting related sensors, so good enough for now. As it is not accurate, anywhere between 0 to inf steps might be needed (/j), but figuring out how many should keep you up for a while. 

Vibe coded with cursor (with necessary vibe checks).
Any vibe checks (issues/bugs/suggestions) are welcome.
